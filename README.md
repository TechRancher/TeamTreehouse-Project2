# TeamTreehouse-Unit2
This program takes in a list of students. Through JavaScript Pagination I added that 10 students per page will be displayed and also added page numbers at the bottom of the page. So, if there are more than 10 students in the list of students the remaining students will be displayed on another page. The active page number will be highlighted. You can also search through the student list and it will either return the student if found or it will return no student with that name found with a reset search option. 
Feel free to look over it.
